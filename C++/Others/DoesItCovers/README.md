#  Check if the Array B covers Array A

You will read in data for two integer arrays, A and B.   

definition:  Array B is said to cover array A if for every item in array A, there exists a unique item in array B that can be matched (has equal value) to the item in A.   
A single item in B cannot be matched to more than one item in B.    

Your job is to determine if array B covers array A or not based on the data you read.   If array B covers array A, then you will print 

	array B covers array A

otherwise you will print

	array B does not cover array A
